# About
Coop Friend Finder was a website I designed with the idea of bringing people together who were looking
for friends to play like minded games with. The idea was simple. If you wanted to play a game with someone
but didn't have someone to play it with you would use Coop Friend Finder to see if anyone posted a listing
for the game you want to play. If you found someone you could "request to play" with them and that person
would get a notification via text/email/push. Or you could create a listing yourself. 

After playing with said person you could them rate them up or down.

## Under The Hood
The website was written in NodeJS. It used Twillio for text message notifications and Stripe for use payments
for site donations (it was completely free to use) or if you wanted to purchase additional features such
as text message notifications.
